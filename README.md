# cve-cvss-score-prediction
Predict the risk score (CVSS) of a cybersecurity vulnerability (CVE) based on its description using Natural Learning Processing (NLP)

The flow of a CVE analysis starts with detecting it and writing a description by researcher 1, and then researcher 2 computes a score based on CVSS guidelines. Our model goal is to replace researcher 2 and allow fast alerting of new vulnerabilities that require attention.

This code is apart of a Kaggle competition [Vulnerability risk scoring](https://www.kaggle.com/t/cf26b9dbc9dd4bfa956656224cd5bd6a)
In this project, we use tfidf with different ensemble techniques: Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost and Stacking.

The notebook present analysis of the problem and exploratory data analysis.
