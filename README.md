# cve-cvss-score-prediction
Predict the risk score (CVSS) of a cyber security vulnerability (CVE) based on its description using Natural Learning Processing (NLP)

This code is apart of a Kaggle competition [Vulnerability risk scoring](https://www.kaggle.com/t/cf26b9dbc9dd4bfa956656224cd5bd6a)

In this project we use tfidf with different ensemble techniques: Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost and Stacking.

The notebook present analysis of the problem and exploratory data analysis.
